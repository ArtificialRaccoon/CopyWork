# What is Copywork?

Copywork is the practice of manually transcribing texts you admire—word by word, punctuation mark by punctuation mark—to supposedly absorb the author's style through repetition.

Is it pseudoscience? Probably. But it does have a real benefit: it forces you to slow down and notice how good writing actually works. You catch the rhythm of sentences, the placement of commas, the structure of paragraphs. You can't skim when your fingers are doing the work.

Think of it as learning to paint by copying the masters—you won't become them, but you'll develop a deeper appreciation for their craft.
